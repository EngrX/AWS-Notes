# AWS CLOUD PRACTITIONER ESSENTIALS NOTES.


### THREE (3) DEPLOYMENT MODELS
    CLOUD-BASED (PUBLIC CLOUD)
    ON-PREMISES (PRIVATE CLOUD)
    HYBRID CLOUD DEPLOYMENT


#
CLOUD-BASED DEPLOYMENT MODEL
    1.  RUN all parts of your application to the Cloud
    2.  MIGRATE existing application to the Cloud 
    3.  DESIGN and BUILD new applications from scratch in the Cloud.

ON-PREMISES DEPLOYMENT MODEL
    >   Resources are deployed on-premises using virtualization and management tools 
    1.  DEPLOY RESOURCES by using virtualization and resource management tools
    2.  INCREASE resource UTILIZATION by using application management and virtualization technologies

HYBRID DEPLOYMENT MODEL
    >   Cloud-Based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.
    1.  Connect CLOUD-BASED (PUBLIC) to ON-PREMISES (PRIVATE) Infrastructure.
    2.  Integrate CLOUD-BASED resources with legacy IT Applications.

SUMMARY:
1. THREE DEPLOYMENT MODELS: PUBLIC, PRIVATE & CLOUD
2. PUBLIC  CLOUD MODEL - LET'S YOU RUN, MIGRATE, BUILD AND DESIGN NEW APPS IN THE CLOUD
3. PRIVATE CLOUD MODEL - LET'S YOU DEPLOY/RUN RESOURCES by using virtualization and management tools ON-PREMISES Infrastructure
4. HYBRID MODEL - COMBINATION of PUBLIC and PRIVATE, connecting CLOUD-BASED resources to on-premises infrastructure


# BENEFITS OF CLOUD COMPUTING 
(AWS VERSION)
1. Trade upfront expenses to variable expenses
    >   By taking a cloud computing approach that offers the benefit of variable expense, companies can implement innovative solutions while saving on costs.
    -   Upfront expense refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them. 
    -   Variable expense means you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them.

2. Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
    >   Computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers. 
    >   A benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers.

3. Stop guessing capacity - use Amazon EC2
    >   With cloud computing, you don’t have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application. 

4. Benefits from massive economies scale
    >   By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.

5. Increase speed and agility
    >   The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.

6. Go global in minutes
    >   The global footprint of the AWS Cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.
        This means that even if you are located in a different part of the world than your customers, customers are able to access your applications with minimal delays. 

(AZURE VERSION)
1. HIGH AVAILABILITY
2. COST-EFFECTIVE - NO UPFRONT COST
3. SCALABILITY
4. ELASTIC - using Azure Load Balancer
5. DISASTER RECOVERY
6. FAULT TOLERANCE
